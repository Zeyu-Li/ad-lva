# Welcome to Our Blog

I **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for building modern web applications!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides many features out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improves SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-renders pages at build time
- **API Routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend
- **File-based routing** - Automatic routing based on file structure
- **Image optimization** - Automatic image optimization and lazy loading

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

## MDX Features

This blog supports **MDX**, which means you can:

1. Write markdown content
2. Include React components
3. Add interactive elements
4. Use JavaScript expressions

> MDX makes it easy to write content with the power of React components.
